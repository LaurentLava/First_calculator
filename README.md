# Project Title

First attempt to do a calculator with the Tkinter module.

## Description

I tried to learn how the Tkinter module was working so I decided to create a simple GUI calculator with that module.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Built on mac
* Need the Tkinter module installed

### Installing

* Clone the repo using

```
https://github.com/LaurentLava/First_calculator
```

### Executing program

* Run the following line

```
python calculator.py
```

## Help

It seems to have a problem with mac rendering the Tkinter module. As a consequence, I could not change the background colour of buttons.
